            <p><strong>Why a Press Release is Still a Valuable Tool:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/2016/09/Cool-Fire-IV-TC-100W.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It's always great to feel like you're part of the action and writing this simple <a href="https://www.vipelectroniccigarette.co.uk/news/post/vip-e-cigarettes-link-up-with-innokin" target="_blank">press release</a> about VIP's link up with Innokin was a cool way to get involved.</p>

<p>Breaking news is always exciting, especially when the news is good news and I was pleased to hear that VIP had won another feather for their cap. For me this brief also, reinforced the idea that a good press release still carries weight. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.innokin.com/vaporizers/cool-fire-iv-tc-100/" target="_blank">Cool Fire IV TC 100W</a> is really pushing the boundaries of vaping style and technology. This vaporiser looks great and it has the power to match its looks, not only that, Innokin have used a 3300mAh battery, which is compact, but will also last all day.</p>

<p>The TC 100 may not be a 200W mega beast used by the ultra hip of the vaping community, those who aspire to blow the perfect "jellyfish" and visit vaping conventions, but it doesn't have to be. This device is aimed at a different type of client, one who's enjoyment of vaping is maybe a little less gregarious and one who just enjoys quality vaping. </p>

<p>The aim of a press release is to keep the media and the public up to date with news about your company. There is ongoing speculation about the death of the press release, but there are several reasons why this is simply never going to happen.</p>

<p>First of all, a press release, written well, is an affordable way of getting information to the media quickly. A press release should take no more than an hour to write and then seconds to distribute - to do this all you need is a list of press contacts. If, of course, you want then to post the release online, distribution will take a little longer.</p>

<p>Second, a press release strategy that has regular frequency built in can build trust amongst journalists who are then more likely to publish the release and comment on it. A good press release is like a birthday present to a journalist or editor because the majority of the work is done for them.</p>

<p>Third, press releases are good for business, sharing good news attracts customers and also investors. Show that your business is a successful one that carries good momentum and people will start to wonder why and then investigate.</p>

<p>The press release - dead? Au contraire, it's a cheap, easy and effective marketing tool that is very much alive, well and helping companies thrive.</p>
